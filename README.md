# RandomSimpsons

## About
Spits out a random episode from the golden era of The Simpsons (defined by me as seasons 2 through 8), and keeps track of what episodes have already been picked.

## Installation
- Install Elixir ~1.6
- Clone this repository
- In your terminal, from the home directory of the project: `mix escripts.build`

## Use
`./random_simpsons` will give you a random golden era episode to watch.

Repeat until you've seen them all!

To start your journey over, delete the `episodes.json` file.
